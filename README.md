xljsx-lite
=======

Generate .xlsx files in the browser using JavaScript with a minimal footprint.

This code is based off of code from [egeriis/zipcelx](https://github.com/egeriis/zipcelx), but modified to allow for multiple sheets without the bloat of trying to maintain backwards compatibility for the `sheets` property. Also, it seems that repo is not maintained, so I hope to continue the project myself!

If you're looking for advanced functionality, [js-xlsx](https://github.com/SheetJS/js-xlsx) is a solid choice.
